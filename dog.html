       The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a 
        diverse variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds 
        recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers 
        mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social 
        benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of 
        loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators 
        such as <a class="textlink" href=https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554>
          reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles.</a>
         If you
         have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your dog;
        be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities
        for exercise. In this page, you will find more information about how
         to care for your pets throughout the various stages of their lives.

       <h2 class="pet-title">Diet and Exercise</h2>
       <p class="dog-para">
        Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals 
        as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then 
        introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six 
        months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per 
        day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to 
        one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body mass is 
        composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The ASPCA says just
         a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent 
         loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
    Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their 
    organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for 
    exercise varies greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range 
    of 30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising
     two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But
      the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog 
      does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK 
      too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; 
      just be sure they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful
       attention to toys that require supervision.

        Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure
         to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled 
         fur that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as 
         ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only
          important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed
           the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be
            sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause 
            allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No 
            matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If 
            you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the 
            forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with
             both your arms perpendicular to the dog, 
        and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.

     <p class="dog-para dog-last-para">
      You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that
       are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as 
       hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the 
       environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include 
       <a class="textlink" href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet">Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.</a>
