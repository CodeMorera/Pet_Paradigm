      Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia
       region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet 
       in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented
        cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, 
        some diets and practices are generally recommended for the 
        well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed

      It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat
       that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if
        possible. Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its
         growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing
          at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten
           directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons 
           why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:
           <ul class="catfood">
             <li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
             <li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
             <li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
           </ul>

    <p class="cat-para">
      Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically 
      around three to four weeks after birth. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a> , kittens 
      at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine
       ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating
        hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat
         food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients 
         that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed,
          your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always
           consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.

      This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients.
       At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism.
        It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide
         food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout 
         the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related 
         feline ailments.

    <h2 class="pet-title">Seven Years and More</h2>
    <p class="cat-para">
      Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience 
      a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more 
      quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat,
       look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just
        a category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations,
         of lesser quality proteins.
